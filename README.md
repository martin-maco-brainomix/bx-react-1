# BX React Workshop: Building a Scan Management Application

## Overview
This project implements a React-based frontend application that interfaces with a Brainomix backend API. The application provides functionality for displaying and managing scan records through a user-friendly interface.

## Project Objectives
- Create a responsive data table displaying scan records
- Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) via API integration
- Develop a professional and user-friendly interface

## Prerequisites

### Technical Skills
- Fundamental programming concepts:
  - Variables, control structures, and functions
  - Data structures (arrays, objects)
  - Basic algorithm understanding
- Code organization and syntax knowledge
- Familiarity with development best practices
